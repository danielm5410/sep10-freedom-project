      <div class="accordion-body"> About 10,000 years ago, humans began to domesticate plants and animals. By staying in one place, families and larger groups were able to build communities instead of a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle that is dependent on foraging and hunting for survival.</div>

    <div id="flush-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingTwo" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
      <div class="accordion-body"> This was called the neolithic era. The farmers started farming emmer wheat, einkorn wheat and barley. These were the first few crops to be ever harvested. These early farmers also domesticated lentils, chickpeas, peas and flax. Neolithic farmers selected for crops that harvested easily. Wild wheat, for instance, falls to the ground and shatters when it is ripe. Early humans bred for wheat that stayed on the stem for easier harvesting. Around the same time that farmers were beginning to sow wheat in the Fertile Crescent, people in Asia started to grow rice and millet.
In Mexico, squash cultivation began about 10,000 years ago, while corn like crops emerged around 9,000 years ago.</div>

    </h2>
    <div id="flush-collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingThree" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
      <div class="accordion-body"> Scrapers are one of the original stone tools, found everywhere where people settled, long before the Neolithic Age began. Scrapers were used both to butcher animals, and then to remove meat from the hides. The hides could then be cured as leather. A scraper is a flat piece of stone with one longer slightly curved edge. The edge is sharpened by banging off flakes with another rock. While a scraper can be used for cutting into an animal, a longer, thinner blade can be inserted deeper into a carcass, or run along a bone, and works better for the fruits and vegetables of a settled agricultural life. Blades are more difficult to make than scrapers; when banging it down to a thin piece of rock, it is easy to snap the piece in two. Arrows and spearheads are a more sophisticated shape than simple scrapers and blades. Not only is the tip more delicate, but to shape the end of the head to slip into the shaft, and also provide protrusions that could be used to tie the point in place, required a new degree of precision and care. The polished stone ax is considered one of the most important developments of the Neolithic era. Once the ax was shaped through flaking, another stone was used to grind it smooth. Axes make the clearing of land much simpler, allowing the spread of agriculture. Axes also make effective weapons, and it is thought that many Neolithic axes were meant to be used on enemies rather than trees. The need for self-protection led to a more centralized village life within high walls. Chisels were made by attaching a sharp piece of stone to the end of a sturdy stick. Hammers were made by rounding a rock, and either drilling a hole through it or creating a notch around the outside that could be used when securing the head to a handle by rope or sinew. Hammers were mostly used with chisels in woodworking, though the difference between a hammer and a war club is really only in the use. The adze is a woodworking tool. It is a flat blade attached to a handle, somewhat like an ax, except that the blade is turned horizontally, somewhat like a hoe. When it strikes a piece of wood it gouges out a chip. It was and is still used in cultures that make dugout canoes, as it is one of the fastest ways to hollow out a log. A larger adze also makes an effective tool for digging, removing roots and generally preparing land for planting.</div>

Agrivi helps farmers to manage all field activities, finance, inventory, workforce and get insight into overall farming performance with a singe click.  Agrivi also has  automated pest and disease detection to alert farmers to protect crops timely. It also helps with tillage, planting, crop protection, fertilization, irrigation, harvesting, and all other activities are very easy and manageable with a few clicks. Another one is granular. Granular helps farmers with more productive farming and allows farm owners and managers to look over  all aspects of operations even while traveling. They can even schedule and assign tasks to their workers and allow field and office hands to work collaboratively. Granular also assists companies in keeping their stakeholders up-to-date.

There's this one hardware that helps you milk cows efficiently. It also monitors everything from milk output and number of milking per day to the number of steps that a cow takes in a given day. A usual human schedule milks the cow about twice per day, as opposed to the machine milking as often as five or six times a day. There's this other hardware called the Hybrid planter. The electric multi-hybrid planter is intended to help farmers enjoy the best of both worlds by giving them the ability to automatically change the seeds they plant. It also uses a single seed tube in order to eliminate gaps when transitioning from one seed type to another.</div>

                                <h3>Current farming hardware</h3>
                                <p> There are many new farming hardwares that help farmers maximize efficiency and profit like The electric multi-hybrid planter. It is intended to help farmers enjoy the best of both worlds by giving them the ability to automatically change the seeds they plant. It also uses a single seed tube in order to eliminate gaps when transitioning from one seed type to another.</p>

                                <h3>Future farming technology</h3>
                                <p>I have an idea where you can fully control your farm with your phone or your computer without internet since Wi-Fi and cellular is scarce in most areas of farmland. With the app, you can harvest all your crops on your phone and water them automatically. You can also sell your crops and manage all the bugs and pests on your phone too. Something like an automated seed planter and harvester. You will have to farm the most efficiently in the future like, farming upwards instead of outwards, because the population will increase and the amount of farming will have to increase to feed everyone. You can do this while making a good margin profits and being able to be cheap and affordable for everyone in every social class.</p>
